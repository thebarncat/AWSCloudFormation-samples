AWSCloudFormation-samples

The AWS CloudFormation samples package contains a collection of templates that illustrate various usage cases. Stacks can be created from the templates via the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, the AWS CloudFormation APIs, or the AWS Toolkits. You can use the templates as-is or you can use them as a starting point for creating your own templates. All the sample templates can be downloaded [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/AWSCloudFormation-samples.zip).
